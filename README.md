I plan to write book reviews mainly on epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of science, and cognitive psychology.
I will also share inspirational podcasts and reviews of academic research papers.

*Life is like **a greedy algorithm**. Instead of obsessing over the past or worrying too much about the future, cultivate a mindset that focuses on the present. Sometimes, we need to take a step back to see the bigger picture. The best choice in a single moment may not always be the best in the long run. Still, what matters is showing diligence by giving your best at every moment* 🙂
